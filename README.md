We were a group of three classmates that came together in order to solve a very common problem. We used an Android based application for implementing technology into a domain where traditionally, very less technology has been used. Our intentions were simple. We aimed to reduce the distance between the customer at the restaurant and the servers.  The project aimed to incorporate state-of-the-art techniques in Android along with the goal of achieving high accuracy with a real-time performance. This application will aim to save a user’s order requests automatically, offer suggestions when the user is stuck and come full of links for how coffee is made, and where the beans are sourced from, among other things and will offer other resources to help the user’s journey of selecting his/her coffee a lot more intuitive.
